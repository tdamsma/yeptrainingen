A co-creation workshop works in two ways: one or more issues from the organization are thoroughly examined, and your team learns about various techniques to come up with new and good ideas together. The techniques used depend on the frameworks outlined by the issue. We always provide tools to prevent <em>Groupthink</em> and stimulate creativity. It's really fun to do with a group and it definitely releases inspiration and energy!

The workshop is also well-suited for larger groups, for example at a conference. We can also adapt the workshop to be conducted digitally. A comprehensive workshop lasts 3 hours, but a 60-minute setup is also possible.
