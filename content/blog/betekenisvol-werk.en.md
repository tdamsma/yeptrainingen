**How to Translate Your Values and Ideals into Concrete and Meaningful Work**

> “Beep-beep-beep!”  
> The alarm goes off. You sigh and roll over again. After hitting _snooze_ more times than you should, you finally drag yourself out of bed.  
> To get ready for work. Because that’s what you’re supposed to do.
>
> You’re not really looking forward to it. You no longer feel much joy, fun, or challenge in your work.  
> Deep down, you sense that you’re capable of something greater.  
> But you don’t quite know _what_ that is, or how to find meaningful work that truly fits you.  
> So you stay. At least for now. Or maybe not?

## What if…

- it **were possible** to go to work with real joy
- you found a job that **matches your values and ideals**
- you went to work with **as much energy as you come home with**
- and you even got paid for it?!

Wouldn’t that be something? You long for this.  
But… **how do you actually find such a job?**

First of all, when I say great work, I mean work that feels right, that moves you, that gives meaning.  
And maybe something is stirring inside, a longing for more purpose.  
It takes courage to use your talents for something bigger. And the steps below can help create clarity.

Thinking of great work reminds me of a passage from a speech by Steve Jobs that I sometimes show in our Talent Development Program:

> “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  
> And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.  
> If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.  
> As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.  
> And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.”

## Three Steps Toward Meaningful Work That Fits Your Values and Ideals

### 1. Discover Your (Work) Values and Ideals

It all starts with **self-knowledge**. Get to know yourself better and explore what truly matters to you at work.  
You can do this through tests, conversations with a career coach, or talks with people who know you well.  
The following exercises, and the short list of work values below, can also help you on your way.

**Exercises:**

- Make a list of all the (side) jobs you’ve ever had.  
  Look for the common thread: which elements gave you energy, and which drained it?  
  This helps you see what actually brings you joy at work (and what doesn’t).
- Dare to think (or dream) big! If _anything_ were possible, what would you want to change in the world?  
  What problems would you want to help solve? What did you dream of doing as a child?  
  If you truly allow yourself to dream, chances are you’ll uncover your deeper ideals.
- Identify which **work values** matter most to you. Below you’ll find some examples.  
  Circle the **five** that feel most important.

|                          |                            |                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Helping people           | Large organization         | Having influence          |
| Experiencing autonomy    | Structured tasks           | Flexible working hours    |
| Few colleagues           | Working outdoors           | Working with your mind    |
| Small/flat organization  | Caring for people          | Fixed working hours       |
| Stability/security       | Traveling for work         | Variety                   |
| Self-development         | No boss / be your own boss | Working creatively        |
| Contributing to society  | No responsibility          | Learning new things       |
| Physical work            | Status                     | Collaborating with people |
| Working indoors (office) | Working with your hands    | Working under pressure    |
| Large organization       | Growth opportunities       | Being meaningful          |

Find ways that help _you_ get to know yourself better.  
This process may take longer than you expect — but once you know which elements of work give you energy and have clarified your ideals, you can start taking action.

### 2. Speak Up!

Once you know what drives you in a job, **talk about it!**  
Share your search for meaningful work with people you meet — in your friend group, at the coffee machine, at social events, with family, or even at the supermarket.

You might be surprised how many people will think along with you:

> “Have you ever thought about this kind of job?”  
> “Oh, I might know someone who could help you with that.”

Let yourself be inspired by the thinking — and networking — power of the people around you.

It also helps to formulate a **clear intention** for yourself. For example:

> “By November 2026, I’ve found a job where I can contribute as an engineer to improving my country’s coastal defenses.  
> I want to be a link in collaboration and help ensure resilience and safety.”

Or:

> “Starting this spring, I want to work informally with friends on a European technology that replaces WhatsApp — built right from the ground up.  
> I want to be my own boss, keep creativity and joy at the center, and stay focused on the progress we’re making.”

The more concrete you make your intention, the sooner it can become reality.  
You can believe it or not — but what if it works? Try it for yourself.

### 3. Look for (or Create) Your Dream Job

And then it’s time to take action.  
To make your intention real, you’ll need to get moving.

Here are a few suggestions:

a. **Reach out to people** who already do the kind of work you aspire to.  
 If you don’t know any, search LinkedIn by job title, take the leap, and ask if you can interview them about their work.

b. **Browse through job openings** that seem to match your ideals and work values.  
 Don’t hesitate to call organizations to ask whether the role might suit you.

c. **Shadow someone for a day** in your potential dream job — to see what it really looks like in practice.

## Wishing you all the best as you keep looking!
