Our Talent Development Program (TDP) is our flagship program in which we help individuals and organizations achieve social impact. Starters with up to 6 years of work experience follow this intensive and broad program in a group of up to 12 participants. Everything related to personal effectiveness and collaboration in the workplace is covered. This enables participants to stand strongly in their organizations and make the impact they aim for.
