As a trainer I draw inspiration from my nephews. Why? Because they are experts in continuous learning without ever getting intimidated! They learned to walk by simply observing, trying, falling and getting back up. I enjoy watching this growth mindset in action. This is what I encourage during my trainings. "Dare to make mistakes and learn!"
