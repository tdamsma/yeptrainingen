I am a trainer with a background in psychology and I am the founder of Yep Trainingen. Working as a trainer is exciting, challenging and diverse for me. I am constantly searching for the context in which a person or group can experience their impact and learn.

I am most keen on the topics communication, coaching skills, and personal effectiveness.
