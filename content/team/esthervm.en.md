In my work as a trainer and trainingactor at Yep, I draw on my extensive experience in education as a drama teacher and team leader. My focus is on experiential learning, infused with a healthy dose of humor and enjoyment. I invite you to take a look in the mirror. What patterns are holding you back? What potential do you see?

My mission is to boost your self-confidence and provide you with practical tools, enabling you to take control and feel proud of yourself. The trainings I host are centered around communication, personal leadership, and team development.
