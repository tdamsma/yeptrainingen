Career coaching offers an opportunity for thorough self-examination. It involves exploring who you are, what meaningful work means to you, and what unique talents you possess. You will discover what is needed to take a step you previously didn't dare to take.

Are you unsure if you are in the right place within the organization, looking for more challenge, or searching for a new job but don't know where to start? Career coaching is for anyone who looks to take conscious career steps. This also applies to people who are happy with their current job.

## What excites you?

Career coaching is very concrete about the next steps in your career, but there is more to it. You will find out where your talents lie. Or maybe you already know, and it is important for you to work on the question of what truly excites you. This can be very beneficial for anyone who feels they have rolled into their current job and are ready to focus on their own dreams and wishes.

Career coaching thus offers plenty of space to get to know yourself better. This self-examination also includes facing limiting thoughts and making room for new thoughts so that you can take the next step with confidence.
