Empowering Teams and Leaders

**Coaching Leadership** is a high priority for many organizations. Whether you work in healthcare, education, or as a consultant, traditional leadership based on sanctions and rewards often falls short. Instead of increasing engagement and effort, it creates dependency on external factors such as the presence of the leader. This comes at the expense of motivation and the sense of ownership employees exhibit, which often negatively impacts the atmosphere, safety, and results.

What we also frequently encounter is a loose leadership style. Responsibilities are not clearly assigned, roles and rules are poorly defined. This can result in employees hesitating to address each others behaviour. The lack of clarity creates a barrier: "Is it appropriate for me to address you on this issue?" This can lead to avoidance behavior, complaints about colleagues, and delayed problem detection.

**Coaching leadership** provides a powerful alternative. By guiding employees with an engaged attitude and asking the right questions, you encourage them to think independently and take responsibility.

> Robert, Production Manager at a metal company - "All our team leaders and assistant team leaders have received support from Yep in conversation skills. They really needed this for the transition from executor to supervisor. How do you handle everyday situations, position yourself in a pleasant way, conduct performance reviews, and prepare when bad news needs to be delivered? It is nice that they have received a common foundation in this. The training sessions were in small groups and practically oriented, very suitable for our teams. Yep also kept HR and management sharp on how they could facilitate and embed desired changes in the organization."
