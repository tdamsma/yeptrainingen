On a daily basis I am occupied with personal growth in others and myself. The Dutch word for 'development' is 'ontwikkeling'. An interesting word if you take the meaning litterally 'reduce difficulty' or in other words: simplify. To be more connected to your core and remove difficult layers and patterns. I enjoy helping clients through this proces and teaching them the tools they can use to get closer to their goals.
