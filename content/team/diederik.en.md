With my background as a jazz trumpeter and composer, I believe it’s important for people to approach their development as a creative experiment. You try things out, step out of your comfort zone, kill your darlings, and learn from it to move forward. As a trainer and coach, I am grateful to play a role in that process. I often hear that I bring calm, ask thought-provoking questions, and use humor effectively.

You can turn to me for training in communication skills, personal leadership, leadership, and team dynamics (sometimes even with music—because that resonates!).
