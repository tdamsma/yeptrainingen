On the one hand to grow themselves, on the other hand because they know they can make a tangible contribution to the organization and society if they really dare to stand up for something.",

    "coaching_intro": "Yep provides coaching for driven professionals, focusing on enhancing your strength and effect. Coaching offers a solution in two cases: when you (or your employee) have a very specific learning goal that does not closely align with a group training, or when you need personal guidance. The coaching can stand alone or be a supplement to a (talent) program. To get an idea of the themes on which we have already guided other professionals, you can take a look below.",

    "coaching_visie_text": "A coaching trajectory always looks different. Many people have enough direction from one or two sessions to continue independently. Others prefer long-term contact where they can, for example, discuss different aspects of their function or collaboration. Although the coaching itself can vary greatly in duration and content, our vision is always the same. We believe that everyone has the information and skills at home to move forward with a plan or goal. Coaching helps to focus attention, have a stick behind the door, reflect, come to new insights, make a well-considered choice. This ensures that a participant remains in control, makes choices they truly support, and does not become dependent on the coach.",

    "aanpak_impact_p2": "To address these, we need people who can listen, collaborate, reason critically, innovate, and build. People who do not get stuck in prejudices, top-down actions, and short-term gains, but who know how to initiate and sustain sustainable improvements. People who push themselves and do not stay in the comfortable zone.",

    "aanpak_target_p1": "In 2010, we guided our first participant. Initially, our focus was on young talents. By now, we have worked with hundreds of groups and found that our methodology also appeals greatly to more experienced professionals. It makes sense: everyone, young and old, occasionally needs a new impulse. Therefore, we no longer only work for young professionals but also for experienced professionals who want to further discover and express their voice. Often, these are professionals who want to make a social impact. Employees who want to spread their wings and are eager to develop. It is wonderful to support the social organizations we find important in their drive to innovate and keep in touch with what is needed in society and the workplace.",
    "aanpak_target_p2": "What do people who want to make (more) social impact have in common? The driven professionals we have guided in more than 20 municipalities and many foundations, associations, and commercial companies share a number of characteristics. We highlight the most important ones and show with examples how we translate them into our methodology.",

    "aanpak_tips_ul2": "Provide an inspiring vision for the future and explore whether your employees feel connected to it. Then give your employees as much autonomy as possible to determine the 'how?'",
    "aanpak_tips_ul3": "Introduce a culture of play and experimentation, where it is allowed to try something without being tied to it. This gives room for those employees whose perfectionism gets in the way.",
