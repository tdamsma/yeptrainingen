It inspires me to work with people who have the courage and endurence to contiously find their own path. They make difficult decisions and often need to acquire new insights and skills. In my work as a coach I love to stand close-by and provide support during this path-finding adventure. I am a member at the Dutch professional organisation for coaches (NOBCO) and work conform the International Ethical Code for coaches.
