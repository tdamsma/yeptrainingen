# yeptrainingen

This is the source of the website of yeptrainingen

As the website is public, I thought I might as well make the source public. It is built using Nuxt.js.
All structured content is in Markdown files that is converted to a static website at build time.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
