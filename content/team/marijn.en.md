I am a trainer with a background in psychology and I am the founder of Yep Trainingen. Working as a trainer is exciting, challenging and diverse for me. I am constantly searching for the context in which a person or group can experience their impact and grow.

I am most keen on the topics communication, coaching leadership, and personal effectiveness. Marijn@yeptrainingen.nl
