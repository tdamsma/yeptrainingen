As a psychologist, trainer and coach it energizes me to get teams and individuals moving. They take steps for themselves, their organisation and also to make society and our world a bit sweeter.

Clients find me entusiastic, pragmatic and describe me as someone who brings what is needed through humor and confrontation. My main subjects are effective communication, (personal) leadership and team development.
